# MNIST GAN - Handwritten Digit Generator

This project implements a **Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)** using **PyTorch** to generate handwritten digits similar to those in the MNIST dataset.

## 🧠 Model Overview

The GAN architecture includes:
- A **Generator** that learns to create realistic digit images.
- A **Discriminator** that learns to distinguish real images from those generated by the Generator.

The models are trained adversarially — as the Generator improves, so must the Discriminator, and vice versa.

## 🗂️ Dataset

The model uses the **MNIST** dataset of handwritten digits provided by `torchvision.datasets`.

## 🔧 Requirements

To run this project, install the dependencies:

bash
pip install torch torchvision matplotlib
Running the Notebook
Simply open the notebook file and run all cells. It will:

Download and preprocess MNIST data.

Train the Generator and Discriminator for a number of epochs.

Display generated images at specified intervals.
